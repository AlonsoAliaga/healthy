# Your average health plugin!

### Built with Spigot Jar: 1.16.1 

### Versions Tested: 1.16.1

Healthy was made because I noticed that there are zero plugins that offer adjusting these basic stats for a player(specifically). Now you're probably wondering why on earth would I need that? And you probably don't. But I've had moments where I needed to adjust those basic stats for testing things and I'm sure implementing it into a plugin you're working on would be a pain just to remove it later. I do plan to add more health related things for a player but for now, the plugin is pretty basic. This is my first plugin as well, so I'm still polishing things.

## Features

Allows setting hearts, foodpoints, saturation and potion effects to user and player

## Backwards Compatibility

Should work on plenty of version's of Spigot, I just haven't gotten around to testing them yet. Unless Minecraft changes something drastically(like when 1.6 released and changed Health points from an int to double), I doubt it will break for a while. And if it does do that, I'll be here to fix it hopefully
